# Assignment for the technical interview.

Design and build a JavaFX application that will list all the files present in a directory in a tree
view. The app should allow users to change the directory via a menu button, upon selecting the
menu a popup should be given to either enter the directory manually or select it via a file
chooser button.
The app should split the displayed window in 2 parts and show the list of files in one half and the
other half should be used to display the content of files within a tab window. For this exercise,
please limit the allowed file types to “.txt” only. The intention here is NOT to implement a full
text editor.
The user will open the file for display via double clicking the file name from the tree display. The
file contents in the display should be editable and once the user modifies the contents of the
file, a ‘*’ should appear in the tab name indicating the file is modified.
Use “user\Documents\” as the default directory for the application start
Optional extensions
1. Add a save menu or tool bar button to save the displayed contents back to the file, once
the file is saved the ‘*’ from the tab name should disappear
2. Add context menu option in the file tree to “open in Explorer” to open the file location
in Windows Explorer
3. Check if any file/s are modified when closing the application or tab
